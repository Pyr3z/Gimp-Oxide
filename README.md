### Disclaimers

- No guarantees here. I originally wrote these tools 3 years ago and counting, and they make a lot of assumptions about how your machine is configured.

- Heck, I'm not even sure these even work with more modern version of Gimp... `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

- When in doubt, read the source code.

- and as always, fef.
